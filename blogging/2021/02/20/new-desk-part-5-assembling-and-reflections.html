    <p>In <a href="/blogging/2021/02/20/new-desk-part-4-finishing.html">part 4</a> I wrote about the process of choosing and applying a finish to my timber slab desk tabletop. There was now only a ceremonial amount of work left to attach the tabletop to the frame, and my desk would be complete.</p>

<h2 id="attaching-the-frame">Attaching the frame</h2>

</figure>

<p>Rather than screwing the frame directly into the slab, I used socket head screws as an intermediate layer between the screws and the wood. I used fast 5 minute curing epoxy to glue the sockets into holes in the slab. This was more effort, but I didn’t want any risk of cracking the slab, and I figured this way would distribute the force more evenly on a larger area of wood.</p>

<h2 id="final-reflections">Final reflections</h2>

<p>Wow, this was a long journey! The whole project took a lot longer and was much more expensive than I expected (or cared to admit) before I started. Truthfully, I knew it would be a challenge and would take a long time – I had no detailed plan when I started, so I knew I would only know at the end what it would take. Buying a massive chunk of wood was a kind of forcing function – a way of committing myself to the project.</p>

<h3 id="cost">Cost</h3>

<p>An incomplete set of approximate costs (AUD):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Desk frame: $700</li>
  <li>Timber slab (cut and dressed): $600</li>
  <li>Melamine for the mould: $39</li>
  <li>Epoxy: $150</li>
  <li>Sanding disks and foam backing pads: $150</li>
  <li>Finishing products: $260</li>
  <li>Spray gun, masks, and goggles: $150</li>
  <li>Fastenings for assembly: $40</li>
  <li>Access to many tools and materials that I already had or borrowed, about 100 hours of my time, and 20 hours of Bruno’s time: priceless</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s a total of about $2089. If I remember correctly, Go Natural Timbers suggested a ballpark figure of $2500 for the cost of producing the tabletop themselves. This number was slightly shocking to me when I heard it, but having done this project I have a new appreciation for the costs that would be involved. A professional workshop can no doubt have many of the materials much cheaper. For example, I bought packs of 10 sanding disks of each grit only to use 1-2, and a 4 litre pack of epoxy to use only 2 litres. They would buy everything in large quantities and only use as much as necessary for each job. But on the other hand they have to pay for the labour, maintain a workshop, etc, and turn a profit. Overall I probably saved a small proportion of the cost by doing most of the work myself, but I definitely wouldn’t embark on this kind of project to save money!</p>

<h3 id="experience">Experience</h3>

<p>There were a lot of challenges but I loved every bit. I learned how to use a number of new tools, including a belt sander, random orbital sander (I now also know what that is), spray gun, and blowtorch. I learned about the different types of epoxy and how to use them, and about the different types of wood finishes. I only wish that I had a degree in chemistry so I could understand the ingredients in epoxy and finishing products.</p>

<h3 id="result">Result</h3>

<p>In my opinion, my new desk is awesome, and it serves its purpose wonderfully. I feel much more comfortable using it than my old desk thanks to the adjustable height and the ability to stand, and the quality of the surface is as good as I could have hoped.</p>

<p>Besides its utility, It looks beautiful. This is mostly just down to it being made from a huge piece of wood – but I’m happy that I didn’t fuck it up too much. Whenever I am bored, or waiting for code to compile, I gaze at the grain and try to imagine the tree and how it grew that way.</p>

<p>Despite that it has many imperfections. There are filled cracks where the epoxy is permanently soft, delaminations between layers of epoxy, cracks that were not filled, epoxy shrinkage, bubbles, a splotchy surface on the edges, a minor warp, and probably more issues that I’ve forgotten or haven’t noticed. But none of these things ruin it. They remind me that I made it myself.</p>
